## Solution
The file is a combination of 3 files, part1 is a png file, part2 is a text file, part3 is a pdf file. Each part has one part of the flag. part1 and part3 can be directly opened by changing the file extension of the file. For part2 we need to open the file in a text editor, you can search for the string "flag" and you will find the 2nd part.
