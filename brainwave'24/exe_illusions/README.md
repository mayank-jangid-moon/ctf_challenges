## Solution
The zip file contains to files named file1.exe and file2.exe, they are basically text files which contain the hex code for 2 files, we need to convert that hex to binary and write them in a binary file. We get a PNG file and a password protected ZIP file, the password for the ZIP File can be extracted through LSB Stegno from the png image. The ZIP contains around 150 pdf files, out of which one is different, containing a brainfuck script which prints the flag.
